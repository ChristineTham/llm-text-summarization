    "summary": "World War II was a global conflict from 1939 to 1945 involving most countries and two opposing alliances, the Allies and Axis. The war resulted in an estimated 60 million deaths, including 20 million military personnel and 40 million civilians. Nazi Germany perpetrated the Holocaust, while Japanese troops committed brutal acts, such as the Nanking Massacre. The Soviet Union also perpetrated war crimes.\n\nThe Allies had economic and population advantages, but Germany's blitzkrieg attacks initially mitigated these. Advances in technology played a crucial role, including strategic bombing, airlift, radar, proximity fuze, jet aircraft, and anti-submarine weaponry. The war shifted to one of attrition after the US and Soviet Union joined the Allies.\n\nThe war led to significant global changes, including the establishment of the United Nations, the rise of superpowers, decolonization, and the Cold War. Technological advancements included programmable computers, guided missiles, modern rockets, nuclear weapons, operations research, artificial harbours, oil pipelines under the English Channel, and mass production and use of Penicillin.",
